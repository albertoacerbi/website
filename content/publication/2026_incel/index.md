abstract: "Incels (involuntary celibates) are an online subculture whose members define themselves by a perceived inability to form sexual or romantic relationships. Despite rare but high-profile instances of ideological violence, most empirical research shows that they struggle primarily with poor mental health rather than engage in organized extremism. Yet the group commands disproportionate academic, political and cultural attention, illustrated most recently by Netflix’s Adolescence, which quickly became the platform’s most-watched mini-series of all time and sparked intense political discussion despite being fictional. The incel motif recurs in artistic depictions across film and musical lyrics and has also entered common parlance as a popular insult directed at men. Why are incels so captivating? Drawing on cultural attraction theory and evolutionary psychology, we argue that incel narratives resonate with evolved cognitive biases that make them particularly “sticky.” These include biases towards sex and status related content, moral violations, negativity, coalitional threat, protectiveness of women, and morbid curiosity toward dangerous young men. Incels also qualify as minimally counterintuitive, violating gendered expectations by centering their identity on male sexual exclusion. These features render incel discourse especially memorable and transmissible. We conclude by considering the implications of this cultural virality for media, policy-makers, and public discourse, highlighting the risks of letting cultural attraction rather than empirical accuracy shape responses to the problems incels face and represent in society."
