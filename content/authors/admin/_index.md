  #     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am a researcher in the field of cultural evolution. My work is at the interface of psychology, anthropology, and sociology. I am interested in particular to contemporary cultural phenomena, and I use a naturalistic, quantitative, and evolutionary approach with different methodologies, especially individual-based models and quantitative analysis of large-scale cultural data. I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Sociology and Social Research](https://www.sociologia.unitn.it/en) at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), and member of the [C2S2 - Centre for Computational Social Science and Human Dynamics](https://c2s2.unitn.it).

My last book (published in March 2025) is [Tecnopanico](https://www.mulino.it/isbn/9788815391476) (il Mulino, in Italian).  

Earlier, I wrote a book for Oxford University Press: [Cultural evolution in the digital age](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&lang=en&), and an open access manual: [Individual-based models of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R](https://albertoacerbi.github.io/IBM-cultevo/) (a physical version is available with [Routeldge](https://www.routledge.com/Individual-Based-Models-of-Cultural-Evolution-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-Using/Acerbi-Mesoudi-Smolla/p/book/9781032252063)). I also curate a free substack newsletter (in Italian), with links to material about cultural evolution and digital technologies: [Cinque link a settimana](https://albertoacerbi.substack.com).
