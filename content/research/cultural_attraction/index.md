I am also interested in theoretical aspects of cultural evolution. What is probably my main interest is the debate between cultural attraction theory and “standard” cultural evolution theory. [This paper]({{< ref "publication/2015_phil_bio" >}}) can be a good start to understand what is at stake.

I believe that cultural attraction theory presents some important points that deserve further empirical investigation. Among them, one is the influence of general cognitive factors on culture, from [folktales]({{< ref "publication/2017_EHB" >}}) to [online misinformation]({{< ref "publication/2019_pal_comm_a" >}}). Another is the fact that, in some domains, the actual [content]({{< ref "publication/2018_JOCC" >}}) of cultural traits might be more important than contextual or “social” factors to determine their success. 

 I recently worked on a series of [simulation models]({{< ref "publication/2021_EHS" >}}) that can be considered an attempt to formalise cultural attraction theory.
