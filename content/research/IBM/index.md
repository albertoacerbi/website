I started my academic career as a modeller (in fact, as an artificial life/robotics researcher: [this]({{< ref "publication/2006_JASSS" >}}) is my first publication ever), and I continue to believe that computational models are a fundamental tool to develop research in cultural evolution. On the one hand, models are excellent theory-generating machines: they allow you to formalise your thought experiments, and to explore their consequences, which is sometimes impossible by intuition alone. On the other, models make your theories explicit and directly testable by other researchers. 

In general, I use models to explroe various theoretical questions related to cultural evolution, as well as simulating empirical dynmaics, e.g. information spread on social media. Recent topics include whether [interventions increasing trust on reliable news are more effective than interventions decreasing trust on fake news]({{< ref "publication/2022_HKS_misinfo" >}}) (yes, as reliable news is much more abundant than fake news); if [cultural stability can be obtained without copying or selection]({{< ref "publication/2021_EHS" >}}) (yes); or how [stable individual tendencies interact with social learning forces]({{< ref "publication/2025_pnas" >}}) (as they are directional, differntly from social learning forces, they tend to stabilise culture where they point to). 

I have recently published an open access manual on individual-based models in cultural evolution: [Individual-based models of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R](https://albertoacerbi.github.io/IBM-cultevo/). A physical version is available with [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/Individual-Based-Models-of-Cultural-Evolution-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-Using/Acerbi-Mesoudi-Smolla/p/book/9781032252063).
