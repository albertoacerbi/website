From 2015, I begun to be interested in applyng a cultural evolution framework to the study of digital media and braodly technology. [Here]({{< ref "publication/2016_FHN" >}}) is an early paper where I presented some possible areas of interest and [here]({{< ref "publication/2019_pal_comm_a" >}}) one where I studied online misinformation from a cognitive anthropology perspective. I also worked on how digital media could enhance cumulative cultural evolution, using the case study of [online fan fiction](({{< ref "publication/CP_2020_CHR" >}}), or on how content biases may act differently for the same material if transmitted orally (similar to the telephone game) or [shared online]({{< ref "publication/2022_HN_chains" >}}). 

A main claim coming from this line of research has been that the danger of online misinformation has been exagerated from media and researchers alike. Consistently with an evolutionary approach to social learning, humans are not overly gullible, but we are wary learners. Together with other colleagues, we have pointed out that here has been several [misconceptions on online misinformation]({{< ref "publication/2023_misinfo_on_misinfo" >}}); that people that think online misinformation is dangerous tend to also believe that [other (not themselves!) people are particularly gullible]({{< ref "publication/2024_misinfo_third_person" >}}); and that we would do better to [focus on the broad digital information ecosystem instead that looking specifically to 'fake news']({{< ref "publication/2022_HKS_misinfo" >}}) . I wrote a book on the topic, [published by Oxford University Press in 2020](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943). You won't probably find it in airport bookshops, but it [was generally well received]({{< ref "publication/2019_OUP" >}}). 

More recently, I wrote a book (so far only in Italian) for a borader public, titled [Tecncopanico]{{< ref "publication/2025_tecnopanico" >}}), that tries to give a more nunaced view of the effects of digital technologies, as well as discussing the possible negative side-effects of an overly alarmistic view.

I am also interested, again from a cultural evolutionary perspective, to recent developments in AI. We wrote a review/position paper motivating that [cultural evolution could be a prommising framework to study AI]{{< ref "publication/2023_NHB" >}}), as exemplified by [this reaserch]{{< ref "publication/2023_pnas" >}}), where we use transmission chain experiments to show that Large Language Models have biases similar to human ones.
