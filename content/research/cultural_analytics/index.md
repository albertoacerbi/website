I am interested in the analysis of large, naturally occurring, datasets to investigate (especially modern) human cultural dynamics. "Naturally occurring" datasets are datasets that have not been built on purpose (like surveys, census data, etc.) but represent traces (often digital) of human activities, likes books, songs, movies and, more recently, social media activity. 

For example, I used data on dog registrations to analyse [whether their popularity is due to individual considerations or to social influence]({{< ref "publication/2013_plos_a" >}}); data from [Google Books]({{< ref "publication/2013_plos_a" >}}), the [Gutenberg project]({{< ref "publication/2017_cog_emo" >}}), and [English language songs]({{< ref "publication/2019_EHS" >}}) discovering a general decrease in the expression of emotions, mostly driven by a decrease in _poisitive_ emotions; data on baby names and last.fm playlists to detect whether the [turnover in popularity of cultural traits can give us some indication of the learning biases involved]({{< ref "publication/2014_EHB" >}}), or data on folktales, to check whether [their complexity is correlated with the size of the population were they are diffused]({{< ref "publication/2017_EHB" >}}).

Lastly, I used data coming from social media activity, analysing, among others, [the spread of [ theories]({{< ref "publication/2023_voter_fraud/" >}}) about voter fraud in 2022 US election; the [spread of archological content]({{< ref "publication/2025_scirep_archeo" >}}) on Twitter/X, or [the social media response to Netflix's Our Planet Documentary]({{< ref "publication/2023_our_planet" >}}).    

This line of work is often close to what is done in digital/computational humanities, or what in sociology is referred to as 'cultural analytics'. What makes my research cohesive is the usage of methods and theories from cultural evolution to test hypotheses on these data. To put it with a slogan: "big data need big theory".
